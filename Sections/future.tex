As stated before, we plan to split the work related with this PhD project in two parts: 
\begin{enumerate*}
\item the first part, focused in the single-robot approach;
\item and the second part, focused in the multi-robot approach.
\end{enumerate*}

Therefore, our future work will be focused in trying to find an answer to the RQ2.
In order to achieve it, a detailed study of the current state of the art of features involved with multi-robot choreography such as emergent properties or collaborative strategies must be performed.
