Service robots are invading human lives. They are increasingly used in environments such as houses, airports, hospitals, and offices for performing navigation, transportation, and manipulation tasks. 
The World Robotic Survey~\cite{wrs:online} estimated 35 million indoor service robots to be sold by 2018, accumulating a sales value of \$12 billion since 2015. 
The global sales of household and personal robots is expected to grow by 23.5\% per year~\cite{sheng:online}. 
This increase is accompanied with huge progress in robot technology, especially in image processing, planning, control, and collaboration. Software engineering is key to sustaining this new technology.

A robot typically performs specialized tasks; however, some tasks are highly complex and require a team of robots, whose capabilities (e.g., perception, manipulation, and actuation) are coordinated and supervised. 
Such teams also need to adapt to changes, such as of the environment, of the desired tasks, or of the robot (e.g., hardware failures). 
These demands drive the complexity of robot control software relying on appropriate software architectures. 
To tackle this complexity, we need to rethink design processes~\cite{Lee2008} by properly managing system integration and raising the abstraction levels, addressing qualities like evolvability~\cite{Perez2008}, configurability~\cite{Gamez2013563}, scalability, power consumption, and dependability.

The PhD project presented in this paper is involved in the Co4Robots~\cite{co4robots} European project.
Being part of this project allow us not only to formulate but also to validate our research questions in real-world scenarios.
According to~\cite{roadmap}: ``Usually there are no system development processes (highlighted by a lack of overall architectural models and methods). 
This results in the need for craftsmanship in building robotic systems instead of following established engineering processes".
In fact, most of the robotic applications developed nowadays have to be started from scratch without following well-engineered methods to help in the process.
On the other hand, in this context the aim of the Co4Robots project is to establish systematic engineering process, based on Model-driven engineering (MDE), to facilitate the development of the software for animating robotic systems through the creation of reusable robot building blocks with well-defined interfaces and properties. 

Figure~\ref{fig:overview} depicts an overview of the work being developed for this project.
There is an evident difference between two different approaches in robotic practices, that is when the robotic application puts to work an unique robot or a team of them. 
This division also splits the research schedule of this project in terms of time, as explained in the following.
The ``Single robot" subdivision of the overview represents the work already achieved and work in progress to be achieved in the near future.
This subdivision contains the block of the \emph{Software Architecture}, which is at the same time contained in the \emph{Software Platform} block.
The last mentioned block represents an additional layer for integrating the tools developed by researchers.
Our platform must also be able to be customized by means of \emph{configuration facilities}, which provide the required tools for configuring the basic platform both at design and run-time.

On the other hand, the future work that will be tackled once the single robot contents are already addresses is group in the subdivision of ``Multi robot".
The main expected outcome of this subdivision is to perform the choreography of a deployed team of potentially heterogeneous robots.
In order to do so, issues as \emph{Emergent properties} ~\cite{DeAngelis2015,DeAngelis2016} and selecting the most suitable \emph{Collaborative strategy} \sergio{needed citation} must be addressed.

\textbf{Research Questions.} 
In this project we divide robot applications between single-robot and multi-robot approaches.
For this reason, we state the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item[RQ1] Which are the software engineering practices for single and multi-robotic systems? 
\item[RQ2] Which are the applicable strategies to manage an heterogeneous robotic application?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Contributions.} 
Our contributions are listed in the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Definition of a software architecture able to support a robotic team
\item Validation of the architecture in a real-world scenario
\item Implementation of a software platform where all the algorithms and tools developed can be plugged in 
\item Definition of configuration mechanisms to enable \emph{start-up configuration} and \emph{run-time configuration}
\item Integration of an approach based on ROS+REST for the internal communication between robots
\item Development of the algorithms in charge of perform the choreography, based on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Response to emergent properties
\item Selection of collaborative strategies
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Organization.} 
In Section~\ref{sec:related}, we introduce different works with a similar scope and position our research.
Section~\ref{sec:approach} describes the research approach of the current work.
Then, the next sections present the current state of our work in Section~\ref{sec:single}, future work and planned directions in Section~\ref{sec:multi} and it concludes with Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} with final remarks.
