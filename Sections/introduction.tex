Service robots are invading human lives. They are increasingly used in environments such as houses, airports, hospitals, and offices for performing navigation, transportation, and manipulation tasks. 
The World Robotic Survey~\cite{wrs:online} estimated 35 million indoor service robots to be sold by 2018, accumulating a sales value of \$12 billion since 2015. 
The global sales of household and personal robots is expected to grow by 23.5\% per year~\cite{sheng:online}. 
This increase is accompanied with huge progress in robot technology, especially in image processing, planning, control, and collaboration. Software engineering is key to sustaining this new technology.

A robot typically performs specialized tasks; however, some tasks are highly complex and require a team of robots, whose capabilities (e.g., perception, manipulation, and actuation) are coordinated and supervised. 
Such teams also need to adapt to changes, such as of the environment, of the desired tasks, or of the robot (e.g., hardware failures). 
These demands drive the complexity of robot control software relying on appropriate software architectures. 
To tackle this complexity, we need to rethink design processes~\cite{Lee2008} by properly managing system integration and raising the abstraction levels, addressing qualities like evolvability~\cite{Perez2008}, configurability~\cite{Gamez2013563}, scalability, power consumption, and dependability.

The PhD project presented in this paper is involved in the Co4Robots~\footnote{http://www.co4robots.eu/} European project.
Being part of this project allow us not only to formulate but also to validate our research questions in real-world scenarios.
According to~\cite{roadmap}: ``Usually there are no system development processes (highlighted by a lack of overall architectural models and methods). 
This results in the need for craftsmanship in building robotic systems instead of following established engineering processes".
In fact, most of the robotic applications developed nowadays have to be started from scratch without following well-engineered methods to help in the process.
On the other hand, in this context the aim of the Co4Robots project is to establish systematic engineering process, based on Model-driven engineering (MDE), to facilitate the development of the software for animating robotic systems through the creation of reusable robot building blocks with well-defined interfaces and properties. 

For the process of development of the present project we plan to split the research in two parts.
The first one is based on the research made for understand how to engineering robotic applications.
During this period we try to the software engineering practices for both single and multi-robotic systems.
Furthermore, throughout this division of the research we will study and develop the framework that will be allocated within every robot of our applications.
First, we created the \emph{Software architecture} of the whole system and \emph{Configuration facilities}, which provide the required tools for configuring our architecture both at design and run-time.
Moreover, the \emph{Software platform}, where the two other items will be integrated is being developed in parallel.

On the other hand, the future work that will be tackled once the every robot framework is already addressed is group in the second division of the research, and aims to support the choreography of robotic applications.
The main expected outcome of this subdivision is to perform the choreography of a deployed team of potentially heterogeneous robots in dynamic environments with the presence of human beings.
In order to do so, issues as \emph{Emergent properties} ~\cite{DeAngelis2015,DeAngelis2016} and selecting the most suitable \emph{Collaborative strategy} \sergio{needed citation} must be addressed.

\textbf{Research Questions.} 
In this project we divide robot applications between single-robot and multi-robot approaches.
For this reason, we state the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item[RQ1] Which are the software engineering practices for engineering robotic applications? Which are the limitations?
\item[RQ2] How can Software Engineering improve the process of engineering robotic applications?
\item[RQ3] Which are the applicable strategies to manage a heterogeneous robotic application with only partial knowledge of a dynamic environment?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Contributions.} 
Our contributions are listed in the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Definition of a software architecture able to support a robotic team
\item Validation of the architecture in a real-world scenario
\item Implementation of a software platform where all the algorithms and tools developed can be plugged in 
\item Definition of configuration mechanisms to enable \emph{start-up configuration} and \emph{run-time configuration}
\item Integration of an approach based on ROS+REST for the internal communication between robots
\item Development of the algorithms in charge of manage the robotic team, based on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Management of emergent properties
\item Selection of collaborative strategies
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Organization.} 
Section~\ref{sec:approach} describes the research approach of the current work and we try to answer the first research question.
In Section ~\ref{sec:single} we present the process that we follow for engineering robotic applications and answer RQ2.
Then, in Section~\ref{sec:multi} we explain our plan for managing a robotic team while answering the RQ3.
In Section~\ref{sec:related}, we introduce different works with a similar scope and position our research.
Section~\ref{sec:validation} explains our validation rules.
It concludes with Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} with final remarks.
