Software engineering can be the key technology needed for the improvement of applications developed for robotic systems.
Robots are nowadays a trend, but without well-defined engineering process for the researchers to follow most of the projects are started from scratch.
It results in projects that are not time neither cost efficient.
Furthermore, we plan to perform a detailed research in the state of the art in order to comprenhend the optimal way of managing a collaborative team of robotic agents in dynamic environments with human presence.
In this project we aim to tackle those problems while validating the premises and obtained results with real-world scenarios where real robots work in a collaborative way.
