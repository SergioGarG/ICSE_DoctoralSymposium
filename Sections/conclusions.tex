Software engineering can be the key technology for the improvement of applications developed for robotic systems.
Robots are nowadays a trend, but without well-defined engineering processes, most of the projects are started from scratch.
It results in projects that are neither time nor cost efficient.
Furthermore, we plan to perform a detailed research in the state of the art to identify the optimal way of managing a collaborative team of robotic agents in dynamic environments with human presence.
In this project we aim to tackle those problems while validating the premises and obtained results in real-world scenarios with real robots.
