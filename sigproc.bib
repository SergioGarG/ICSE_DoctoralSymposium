abstract="Runtime enforcement is a powerful technique to ensure that a program will respect a given set of properties. We extend previous work on this topic in several directions. Firstly, we propose a generic notion of enforcement monitors based on a memory device and finite sets of control states and enforcement operations. Moreover, we specify their enforcement abilities w.r.t. the general Safety-Progress classification of properties. Furthermore, we propose a systematic technique to produce a monitor from the automaton recognizing a given safety, guarantee, obligation or response property. Finally, we show that this notion of enforcement monitors is more amenable to implementation and encompasses previous runtime enforcement mechanisms.",

abstract="Chemical-based coordination models have proven useful to engineer self-organising and self-adaptive systems. Formal assessment of emergent global behaviours in self-organising systems is still an issue, most of the time emergent properties are being analysed through extensive simulations. This paper aims at integrating logic programs into a chemical-based coordination model in order to engineer self-organising systems as well as assess their emergent properties. Our model is generic and accommodates various logics. By tuning the internal logic language we can tackle and solve coordination problems in a rigorous way, without renouncing to important engineering properties such as compactness, modularity and reusability of code. This paper discusses our logic-based coordination model and shows how to engineer and verify a simple pattern detection example and a gradient-chemotaxis example.",

abstract="Rigorous engineering of self-organising and self-adaptive systems is a challenging activity. Interactions with humans and unexpected entities, dependence on contextual information for self-organisation and adaptation represent just some of the factors complicating the coordination process among multiple entities of the system. Recently we proposed a coordination model based on logic inference named Logic Fragments Coordination Model. Logic Fragments are combinations of logic programs defining interactions among agents distributed over the nodes of the system. They are able to accommodate various types of logics, ranging from classical up to many-valued paraconsistent ones. The logical formalisation makes it possible to express coordination in a rigorous and predicle way, both at design-time and run-time. In this paper we define, under the form of an evaluation algorithm, the semantics of Logic Fragments; introducing logical predicates used to manage and reason on local and remote information. By associating specific semantics to the symbols inferred during the evaluation of logic programs it is possible to make logical inference effects unambiguous on the system; such an approach turns Logic Fragments into a coordination-oriented logic-based programming model. We conclude the paper discussing three examples showing the use of Logic Fragments to implement on-the-fly ad-hoc coordination mechanisms, as well as design-time and run-time verification of spatial properties.",
